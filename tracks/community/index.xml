      <description>Collaborative governance in software is challenging. This presentation focuses on stakeholder participation which seems limited to those with the technical acumen, tooling expertise, and positions of influence. Yet, evidence shows that great collaboration is dependent on quality divergent thinking balanced with quality convergent thinking. This presentation lays out a strategic framework that curates broader participation by leveraging a landscape of networks and communication channels.
Governance in software development tends to exclude valuable insights from individuals outside the technical sphere.</description>

      <title>Building Healthy Developer Communities: A Versatile Framework for Success</title>

      <description>As developer communities grow both in size and number, it can be easy to lose sight of the importance of community health in the development process. Most tech communities guide their community efforts and future work based on NPS scores and feedback forms. Though well intended, these methods do not provide a full view of the current status of their community members or guarantee they are moving towards a direction that benefits their members or fulfills their needs.</description>

      <description>It takes a village to run an open source project successfully. A village is usually run by its citizens and governed by some elected officials. In open source we call the citizens &amp;ldquo;users&amp;rdquo; and the people in charge of a project &amp;ldquo;maintainers&amp;rdquo;. To understand the health and sustainability of a project we should take a closer look at the community and not necessarily the code in the first place.
To understand their demographics a village can run a census.</description>

      <description>At the Community Over Code Europe 2024, the annual conference of the Apache Software Foundation, join us for an insightful session on understanding the core principle of &amp;lsquo;Community Over Code&amp;rsquo;. This talk will delve into how this philosophy shapes the foundation&amp;rsquo;s approach to software development. We&amp;rsquo;ll explore the significance of prioritizing a collaborative, inclusive community and how this fosters innovation and sustainability in open source projects. Attendees will learn about the practical implications of this ethos in Apache&amp;rsquo;s day-to-day operations and its impact on the broader open-source ecosystem.</description>

      <title>Documentation to Use Open Source Design Templates</title>
      <link>https://eu.communityovercode.org/sessions/2024/documentation-to-use-open-source-design-templates/</link>

      <description>In this session, I share best practices on the way to create bar raising documentation to guide users to use Figma and GitHub templates. To scale best practices in UX Research, designers of open source software create various design artifacts that can help software builders use and improve on the open source code and curated experience offerings. In this talk, I offer examples of how OpenSearch creates process of research that can scale, the process of documentation and create templates that designers and developers in the open source community can utilize in developing experiences for their users.</description>

      <description>Open source has widely grown to allow different tech career paths to enhance projects with their skills and provide jobs for those interested in working with open source. Open source contribution programs provide opportunities for interested individuals to become professionals.
Outreachy is a paid and remote internship OS program that empowers, grows talents, and prepares them for career growth. Outreachy provides internships to people subject to systemic bias and impacted by underrepresentation in the technical industry where they are living.</description>

      <description>Managing an Open Source Program Office (OSPO) team is undoubtedly a unique experience. In this talk I will discuss the unique challenges and best practices for managing software developers in an OSPO environment. I will cover topics such as managing remote teams, maintaining the career progression of OSPO developers, fostering a culture of collaboration and collaborating with the open source community. I will also explore the role of performance metrics in managing software developers in an OSPO, how to align those metrics withe the goals of the organisation and how to help developers balance the needs of the organisation with the needs of the open source community.</description>

      <description>Mentorship and outreach programs are often considered as side projects. Although they are a nice way to spend time and have some fun, one may say they rarely add new long-term contributors to your company project or a community. Is it true? Is it even the main goal? Or is it about team bonding and growing new maintainers and community leaders?
Let’s talk about organizing mentorship programs so that they help to grow your current community and contributors.</description>

      <description>There are millions of open source projects people can use and contribute to. Why yours?
Developing an open source project that is valuable to many and widely accepted in an industry requires a lot of care and feeding – and more than just code. Whether your project is brand new or been around for decades, you need to explain why other people should take the time to learn, use, and potentially contribute to it.</description>

      <guid>https://eu.communityovercode.org/sessions/2024/pretend-its-a-movie-how-to-build-excitement-for-your-apache-project/</guid>
      <description>How do you explain your Apache project to people who don’t even know how to download apps onto their phones – and still manage to get them excited about what you’re working on? It’s simple: pretend you’re talking about a movie.
The problem isn’t the project, but how we’ve been talking about them. And now we’re going to fix that.
In this talk, discover how to completely change the narrative about discussing Apache and open source by not actually talking about open source or Apache&amp;hellip;but instead using the same principles that marketers use to create excitement around a movie.</description>

      <title>Talking with management about open source</title>
      <link>https://eu.communityovercode.org/sessions/2024/talking-with-management-about-open-source/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://eu.communityovercode.org/sessions/2024/talking-with-management-about-open-source/</guid>
      <description>For those of us who already know how important open source is, it can be challenging to persuasively make the case to management, because we assume that everyone already knows the basics. This can work against us, confusing our audience and making us come across as condescending or concerned about irrelevant lofty philosophical points.
In this talk, we take it back to the basics. What does management actually need to know about open source, why it matters, and how to make decisions about consuming open source, contributing to open source, and open sourcing company code?</description>

      <title>Unleash the power of Asynchronous Decision Making</title>
      <link>https://eu.communityovercode.org/sessions/2024/unleash-the-power-of-asynchronous-decision-making/</link>

      <guid>https://eu.communityovercode.org/sessions/2024/unleash-the-power-of-asynchronous-decision-making/</guid>
      <description>The Asynchronous Decision Making techniques commonly used in open source projects enable efficient remote collaboration, in teams which have no boss, no schedule and often no cultural consistency yet produce world-changing software.
These very efficient collaboration techniques can even work without computers and apply to most types of projects, not just software development.
This talk describes the key elements and tools of the Asynchronous Decision Making process, based on more than twenty five years of experience in Open Source projects, as well as examples from federated governments, which, interestingly, work in a similar way.</description>
