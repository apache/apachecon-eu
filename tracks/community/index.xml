      <description>Collaborative governance in software is challenging. This presentation focuses on stakeholder participation which seems limited to those with the technical acumen, tooling expertise, and positions of influence. Yet, evidence shows that great collaboration is dependent on quality divergent thinking balanced with quality convergent thinking. This presentation lays out a strategic framework that curates broader participation by leveraging a landscape of networks and communication channels.
Governance in software development tends to exclude valuable insights from individuals outside the technical sphere.</description>

      <description>It takes a village to run an open source project successfully. A village is usually run by its citizens and governed by some elected officials. In open source we call the citizens &amp;ldquo;users&amp;rdquo; and the people in charge of a project &amp;ldquo;maintainers&amp;rdquo;. To understand the health and sustainability of a project we should take a closer look at the community and not necessarily the code in the first place.
To understand their demographics a village can run a census.</description>

      <title>Documentation to Use Open Source Design Templates</title>

      <description>In this session, I share best practices on the way to create bar raising documentation to guide users to use Figma and GitHub templates. To scale best practices in UX Research, designers of open source software create various design artifacts that can help software builders use and improve on the open source code and curated experience offerings. In this talk, I offer examples of how OpenSearch creates process of research that can scale, the process of documentation and create templates that designers and developers in the open source community can utilize in developing experiences for their users.</description>

      <description>In this presentation, we will delve into the important role that Apache Airflow plays in the Outreachy program and its broader influence in closing inclusion gaps within the open source community. We will explore the success stories and transformative experiences of Outreachy contributors, emphasizing how this open source project has created opportunities for people from diverse backgrounds. Our discussion will focus on the power of open source initiatives like Apache Airflow to foster a more inclusive and accessible technology ecosystem.</description>

      <description>Open source has widely grown to allow different tech career paths to enhance projects with their skills and provide jobs for those interested in working with open source. Open source contribution programs provide opportunities for interested individuals to become professionals.
Outreachy is a paid and remote internship OS program that empowers, grows talents, and prepares them for career growth. Outreachy provides internships to people subject to systemic bias and impacted by underrepresentation in the technical industry where they are living.</description>

      <title>Outreach: The Two-Way Street of Open Source Projects</title>
      <link>https://eu.communityovercode.org/sessions/2024/outreach-the-two-way-street-of-open-source-projects/</link>

      <description>There are millions of open source projects people can use and contribute to. Why yours?
Developing an open source project that is valuable to many and widely accepted in an industry requires a lot of care and feeding – and more than just code. Whether your project is brand new or been around for decades, you need to explain why other people should take the time to learn, use, and potentially contribute to it.</description>

      <title>Pretend it’s a Movie: How to Build Excitement for Your Apache Project</title>
      <link>https://eu.communityovercode.org/sessions/2024/pretend-its-a-movie-how-to-build-excitement-for-your-apache-project/</link>

      <guid>https://eu.communityovercode.org/sessions/2024/pretend-its-a-movie-how-to-build-excitement-for-your-apache-project/</guid>
      <description>How do you explain your Apache project to people who don’t even know how to download apps onto their phones – and still manage to get them excited about what you’re working on? It’s simple: pretend you’re talking about a movie.
The problem isn’t the project, but how we’ve been talking about them. And now we’re going to fix that.
In this talk, discover how to completely change the narrative about discussing Apache and open source by not actually talking about open source or Apache&amp;hellip;but instead using the same principles that marketers use to create excitement around a movie.</description>

      <title>Talking with management about open source</title>
      <link>https://eu.communityovercode.org/sessions/2024/talking-with-management-about-open-source/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://eu.communityovercode.org/sessions/2024/talking-with-management-about-open-source/</guid>
      <description>For those of us who already know how important open source is, it can be challenging to persuasively make the case to management, because we assume that everyone already knows the basics. This can work against us, confusing our audience and making us come across as condescending or concerned about irrelevant lofty philosophical points.
In this talk, we take it back to the basics. What does management actually need to know about open source, why it matters, and how to make decisions about consuming open source, contributing to open source, and open sourcing company code?</description>

      <title>Unleash the power of Asynchronous Decision Making</title>
      <link>https://eu.communityovercode.org/sessions/2024/unleash-the-power-of-asynchronous-decision-making/</link>

      <guid>https://eu.communityovercode.org/sessions/2024/unleash-the-power-of-asynchronous-decision-making/</guid>
      <description>The Asynchronous Decision Making techniques commonly used in open source projects enable efficient remote collaboration, in teams which have no boss, no schedule and often no cultural consistency yet produce world-changing software.
These very efficient collaboration techniques can even work without computers and apply to most types of projects, not just software development.
This talk describes the key elements and tools of the Asynchronous Decision Making process, based on more than twenty five years of experience in Open Source projects, as well as examples from federated governments, which, interestingly, work in a similar way.</description>
