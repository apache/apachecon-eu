      <description>Apache Camel is the leading open-source integration framework that simplifies the integration of various systems and applications. There exists a comprehensive set of Tooling specifically designed to empower Camel developers in their work with Apache Camel within VS Code. These tools facilitate a seamless and efficient development experience, offering robust support and functionalities tailored to the needs of Camel developers.
In my session I would like to rely on the Extension Pack for Apache Camel which contains a set of specific extensions for Camel but also leverages the VS Code ecosystem.</description>
