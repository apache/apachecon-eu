      <description>In the ever-evolving landscape of open source projects, the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) stands at the forefront of innovation and community-driven development. Two of its young projects, Apache Training and Apache Wayang, are working on an exciting journey of expansion and inclusivity.
This session is dedicated to showcasing how these projects are opening their doors to a broader audience, including non-technical individuals, thereby fostering a more diverse and robust community, which helps the ASF to continue in solving some of the worldâ€™s tech problems by bringing people together.</description>

      <description>Q&amp;amp;A is one of the most effective ways to obtain knowledge, build connections, and create interaction. In open-source communities, Q&amp;amp;A is particularly crucial. It not only provides a platform for users and developers to collaboratively tackle technical issues and clarify uncertainties but also enhances the sharing and circulation of knowledge. By helping each other in resolving issues, community members forge stronger bonds and jointly advance their projects. Additionally, a robust Q&amp;amp;A system attracts new members, injecting fresh perspectives and energy into the community.</description>
