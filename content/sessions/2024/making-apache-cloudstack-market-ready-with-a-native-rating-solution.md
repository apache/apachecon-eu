Apache CloudStack (ACS) is a solid option among known cloud orchestration systems, being on the same level as OpenStack, Azure Stack, and others. All of them address the basic needs to create and run a private cloud system; however, ACS's users have to adopt external solutions for rating/billing the resources consumption, which is native in the other orchestration tools (e.g. OpenStack). This presentation will address the design and efforts of the ACS community to implement a native rating feature that will allow more flexibility and reduce the need for external systems.
