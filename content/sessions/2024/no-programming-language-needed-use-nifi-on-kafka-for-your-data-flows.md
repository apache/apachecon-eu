Drag and Drop! In this session, you can find how to build data flow using Apache Nifi over Kafka even if you do not know programming! Apache Nifi is an easy-to-use, powerful and reliable system to process and distribute data. Also if anyone in the team prefers to use a browser-based user interface for data flow rather than coding, this is the best solution to combine your Kafka sources with Apache Nifi. Nifi allows you to design, control, feedback and monitor Kafka sources and provides loss-tolerance with guaranteed delivery. 
 
 
 
 This lighting talk will inspire everyone who is interested in processing Kafka data flow in Nifi and wants to distribute tens of millions of events per second with latency that can be a few milliseconds. If you are interested, join this session and discover what Apache Nifi is and how to implement it with Apache Kafka in best practices.
