This session will be a dive into the internals of SAI and Vector Search in Cassandra 5.0. It will cover the current functionality and limitations of SAI and suggested future priorities for the project. It will also look at the read and write paths for SAI and their relationship to the current Cassandra paths. Finally, it will look at the the in-memory and on-disk data structures used for the indexes and why these were chosen.
