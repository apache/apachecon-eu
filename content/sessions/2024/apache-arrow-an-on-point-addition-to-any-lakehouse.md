Apache Arrow has become a de-facto standard for representing large datasets and a very useful tool in any modern data engineering stack. While it allows different technologies to better communicate and share data, the ecosystem around it enables much more! 
 
 
 
 In this talk we’ll cover how Arrow interacts with Apache Spark - from allowing PySpark to interoperate with other Python data libraries, to building data-driven applications with the recent addition of Spark Connect. We’ll talk about less conventional ways the two technologies could be used together, with hands-on examples for a few common problems that this combination of technologies can solve really well.
