Apache Tomcat implements the Jakarta Servlet, Jakarta Pages, Jakarta Expression Language, Jakarta WebSocket and Jakarta Authentication specifications. Jakarta EE 11 is due for release in the first half of 2024 with the first stable Tomcat 11 release expected shortly afterwards.
 
This session will look at the changes in Jakarta EE 11 for the specifications that Tomcat implements and what these changes mean for developers looking to deploying their application on Tomcat 11.0.
 
This session will also look at the other new features introduced to Tomcat with Tomcat 11 including virtual thread support, automatic TLS certificate reloading, a rate limit filter and support for OpenSSL via Foreign Function Memory support with Java 22 onwards.
