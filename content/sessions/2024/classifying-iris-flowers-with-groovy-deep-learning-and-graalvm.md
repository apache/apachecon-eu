This talk looks at using Groovy for a well-known data-science problem: classifying Iris flowers. It involves solving this problem using the latest deep-learning neural network technologies and has the option of using GraalVM for blazing speed. Groovy provides a data-science environment with the simplicity of Python but using Java-like syntax and your favourite JVM technologies.
