Open source has widely grown to allow different tech career paths to enhance projects with their skills and provide jobs for those interested in working with open source. Open source contribution programs provide opportunities for interested individuals to become professionals.
  
Outreachy is a paid and remote internship OS program that empowers, grows talents, and prepares them for career growth. Outreachy provides internships to people subject to systemic bias and impacted by underrepresentation in the technical industry where they are living. The program empowers, grows talents, and prepares participants with employment needs using the skills they have acquired, giving them experience working on real-life projects and networking with several people in the OSS space while contributing to achieving the same goals.
 
Not only is the Outreachy program helping to build OS contribution experience, but the program is also done remotely, connects mentors with participants, and pays a sum of $7,000 to its participants.
 
 
 
 At the end of this session, beginners, people on the intermediate level, and experts will have enough knowledge of how they can influence the ecosystem through community participation and contribute to its advancement by giving back to the community as mentors and coordinators.
