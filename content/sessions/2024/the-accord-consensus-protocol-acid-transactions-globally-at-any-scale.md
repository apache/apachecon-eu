The Accord Consensus Protocol, providing global leaderless single-network-round-trip consensus using commodity clocks.
 
 
 
 Research from University of Michigan & Apple Inc. introduces ACID-compliant, strict serialisable transactions that can run globally at scale, at high throughput, with low latency.
 
 
 
 This will be a run-through of 
 
 - the importance of ACID transactions in Apache Cassandra,
 
 - how previous consensus protocols work,
 
 - how Accord improves on these to provide its industry leading characteristics.
