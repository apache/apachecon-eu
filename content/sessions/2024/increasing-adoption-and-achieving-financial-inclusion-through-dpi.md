The Digital Public Infrastructure movement has been gaining momentum globally as governments move to DPI-based approaches to create exponential societal outcomes within and across sectors. DPI is composed of open, interoperable technology with transparent, accountable, and participatory governance frameworks to unlock innovation and value at scale. This session will introduce how Apache projects like Fineract recognized as Digital Public Goods are having transformative impact on achieving SDGs. 
 
 
 
 Through presentation of the work Mifos has been undertaking over the past 12 months we will show how capabilities have been enhanced in Payment Hub EE combined with the power of Fineract to cover new use cases of P2G, Voucher Management and Account Mapping. This means that core banking systems such as Fineract with such additions can cover the needs of Governments adopting DPI. This session will cover how the growing focus on DPI is also leading to better cooperation between open source Fintech DPGs and in turn how this is now allowing for increased adoption and hence addressing financial inclusion. The session will update on the latest DPI status, explain how DPGs such as Fineract and PH-EE and protocols such as Interledger fit in and demonstrating impact of adoption of DPI by talking through real-world use cases. It will cover how the ongoing efforts to harmonise and work with other DPGs (MOSIP, Mojaloop) and initiatives (OpenG2P, G2PConnect, GovStack) allows for easier adoption by governments.
