Apache IoTDB, a time series database focused on IoT workloads. At the end of 2022 the major version 1.0 was released which containted many major changes, e.g. a completely new cluster module, new export and import options and new APIS to integrate with Apache IoTDB.
 
 In 2023 three minor releases, namely 1.1, 1.2 and 1.3 have been released but although they are considered minor releases they contain many new features.
 
 
 
 In this talk we give a very basic introduction into the project and want to focus on the changes and improvements that have happened in release 1.0 and thereafter.
 
 Besides this we also want to have a look into the future and highlight some topics the community is working on at the moment and give an inside into the roadmap for planned features.
