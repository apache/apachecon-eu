As developer communities grow both in size and number, it can be easy to lose sight of the importance of community health in the development process. Most tech communities guide their community efforts and future work based on NPS scores and feedback forms. Though well intended, these methods do not provide a full view of the current status of their community members or guarantee they are moving towards a direction that benefits their members or fulfills their needs.
 
 
 
 This session aims to shift the focus towards a holistic view of community well-being with a versatile framework that can be adapted to different tech environments. We will break down this framework into six vital areas for building a robust developer community.
 
 
 
 To make this framework more practical, we will exchange knowledge on monitoring community progress and use it as a reflective tool for strategic enhancement. This talk will provide the keys to unlocking the full potential of a community, fostering environments where developers not only succeed but thrive together.
