Apache Flink is a powerful open-source stream processing framework that supports unified batch and streaming processing. With its SQL support, Flink has become even more accessible to data analysts and developers who are familiar with SQL.
 
In this talk, we will provide a short introduction to Apache Flink and explain how you can leverage SQL under the hood. We will cover some of the SQL-specific features of Flink, such as dynamic tables, streaming SQL and support for stateful operations like windowing and pattern recognition. We will also show some real-world examples of how you can use Flink's SQL capabilities to build scalable and efficient data processing pipelines.
 
By the end of this talk, you will have a better understanding of how Apache Flink can be used to process large volumes of data using SQL, and how you can take advantage of Flink's powerful stream processing capabilities to build robust and scalable data applications.
