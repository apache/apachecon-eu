At the Community Over Code Europe 2024, the annual conference of the Apache Software Foundation, join us for an insightful session on understanding the core principle of 'Community Over Code'. This talk will delve into how this philosophy shapes the foundation's approach to software development. We'll explore the significance of prioritizing a collaborative, inclusive community and how this fosters innovation and sustainability in open source projects. Attendees will learn about the practical implications of this ethos in Apache's day-to-day operations and its impact on the broader open-source ecosystem. This session is a must for anyone looking to grasp the essence of what makes Apache projects thrive and how 'Community Over Code' is more than a slogan, but a guiding principle for success.
