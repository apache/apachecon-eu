Collaborative governance in software is challenging. This presentation focuses on stakeholder participation which seems limited to those with the technical acumen, tooling expertise, and positions of influence. Yet, evidence shows that great collaboration is dependent on quality divergent thinking balanced with quality convergent thinking. This presentation lays out a strategic framework that curates broader participation by leveraging a landscape of networks and communication channels. 
 
  
 
 Governance in software development tends to exclude valuable insights from individuals outside the technical sphere. This common challenge plagues the industry leaving a gap between developers and the non-technical community. Insights that would have driven adoption and utility go uncollected. The way to collect them is to build a landscape that supports many and recognizes the contributions of all. Shepherding a collaborative environment means breaking down the barriers that limit user involvement.
 
 
 
 This presentation begins by examining the barriers. We shed light on the untapped contributors, emphasizing the need for a more comprehensive approach to decision-making and project management. We explore methods to bridge the knowledge gap, making the governance structure more accessible. These strategies, processes, and frameworks empower the whole. Discover how this framework can pave the way for a more effective, transparent, and collaborative software development environment where every stakeholder plays a meaningful role in shaping the future of the project.
