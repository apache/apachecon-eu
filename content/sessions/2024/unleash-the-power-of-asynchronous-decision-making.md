The Asynchronous Decision Making techniques commonly used in open source projects enable efficient remote collaboration, in teams which have no boss, no schedule and often no cultural consistency yet produce world-changing software.
 
 
 
 These very efficient collaboration techniques can even work without computers and apply to most types of projects, not just software development.
 
 
 
 This talk describes the key elements and tools of the Asynchronous Decision Making process, based on more than twenty five years of experience in Open Source projects, as well as examples from federated governments, which, interestingly, work in a similar way.
 
 
 
 It will help you apply similar principles in your own environment, for greater efficiency and happiness.
