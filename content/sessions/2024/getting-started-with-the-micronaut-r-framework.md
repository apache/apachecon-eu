In this session, Sergio del Amo introduces the Micronaut® framework and demonstrates how the Framework's unique compile-time approach enables the development of ultra-lightweight Java applications.
 
Compelling aspects of the Micronaut framework include:
 
Develop applications with Java, Kotlin, or Apache Groovy
 
Sub-second startup time
 
Small processes that can run in as little as 10 MB of JVM heap
 
No runtime reflection
 
Dependency injection and AOP
 
Reflection-free serialization
 
A database access toolkit that uses ahead-of-time (AoT) compilation to pre-compute queries for repository interfaces.
 
Cloud-native features
 
Sergio also demonstrates how you can generate GraalVM native images of your Micronaut applications to achieve instant startup and ultra-low memory footprint.
 
Sergio del Amo is a Micronaut core committer, Developer Advocate for the Micronaut Foundation, and host of the Micronaut podcast.
