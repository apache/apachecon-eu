In this session, I share best practices on the way to create bar raising documentation to guide users to use Figma and GitHub templates. To scale best practices in UX Research, designers of open source software create various design artifacts that can help software builders use and improve on the open source code and curated experience offerings. In this talk, I offer examples of how OpenSearch creates process of research that can scale, the process of documentation and create templates that designers and developers in the open source community can utilize in developing experiences for their users. Finally, I outline the best practices in developing documentation for the use of design templates such as the ones shared on Figma and GitHub. In this talk, I share examples of Figma templates offered to the open source community, documentation offered and the way in which the open source community has utilized these in creating their software solution.
