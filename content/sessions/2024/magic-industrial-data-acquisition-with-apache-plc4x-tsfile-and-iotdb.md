In industrial automation, the established way of collecting data from industrial equipment has many issues. Issues for which Apache provides a number of great ways to avoid them. 
  
In this talk, I want to demonstrate some of the issues I have seen and how we can resolve all of them with combinations of some of the amazing projects we have at Apache:
 
 - How we can use Apache TsFile to directly collect data on the hardware
 
 - How we can build Edge gateways for integrating legacy (and non-legacy) systems via Apache PLC4X
 
 - How all of this data can efficiently be stored in Apache IoTDB
 
 - How Apache IoTDB can act as a central communication-hub for industrial automation applications (Unified Namespace)
