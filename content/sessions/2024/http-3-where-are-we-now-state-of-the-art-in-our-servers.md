As HTTP/3 looks ready we will look to where we are with it in our servers.
 
 The "old" HTTP/2 protocol and the corresponding TLS/SSL are common to Traffic Server, HTTP Server and Tomcat.
 
 The presentation will shortly explain the new protocol and look to different implementation of the protocol.
 
 Then the state of HTTP/3 in our 3 servers and how to implement HTTP/3 in them will be presented.
 
 A small demo supporting HTTP/3 will be run.
