Apache Fineract has a wide range of built-in features, but most companies that integrate Fineract into their applications and services still require some customization of existing functionality or add new features. The usual approach is to fork the upstream project on Github and start right away editing the original code. This approach has a couple of drawbacks, especially that after a while of development the customization gets so complex that pulling changes from the upstream repository makes Git conflicts more likely and contributions back to the upstream project very difficult. In this session I'll show hands-on practical examples from the community that help developers adapt or even replace large parts of Fineract without touching a single line of the original code and sync their forks with zero Git conflicts.
