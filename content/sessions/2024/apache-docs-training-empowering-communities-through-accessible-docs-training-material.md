In the ever-evolving landscape of open source projects, the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) stands at the forefront of innovation and community-driven development. Two of its young projects, Apache Training and Apache Wayang, are working on an exciting journey of expansion and inclusivity. 
 
This session is dedicated to showcasing how these projects are opening their doors to a broader audience, including non-technical individuals, thereby fostering a more diverse and robust community, which helps the ASF to continue in solving some of the world’s tech problems by bringing people together.
 
Our focus will be on the pivotal role of accessible, clear, comprehensive documentation and training materials in making open source projects more attractive. We use the example of Apache Wayang, which aims on serving specific needs of data driven businesses and organizations. 
 
 
 
 We will explore strategies for creating documentation and training content for developers and domain experts that is not only informative but also serving their needs for fast project onboarding and easy to understand. 
 
 This approach is crucial in lowering the entry barrier for new contributors, regardless of their technical background.
 
 Key Highlights of the Session:
 
 
 
 1. Introduction to Apache Wayang and Apache Training Projects: brief overview of the projects, their goals, and their current status within the ASF ecosystem.
 
 2. The Importance of Non-Technical Contributions: Understanding how contributions from non-technical members can significantly enhance the growth and sustainability of open source projects.
 
 3. Strategies for Creating Accessible Content: Practical tips for developing docs and training materials that cater to a wide range of contributors, from seasoned developers to open source enthusiasts with little to no technical background.
 
 4. The Impact of Inclusivity on Community Strength: A discussion on how welcoming non-technical contributors can lead to stronger bonds between projects and a more vibrant, supportive community.
 
 5. Q&A and Community Feedback
 
 
 
 This session is not just a presentation but a call to action for all open source enthusiasts to contribute to the ASF community in diverse ways. Whether you are a developer, a technical writer, an educator, or simply someone passionate about open source, your contributions are valuable.
