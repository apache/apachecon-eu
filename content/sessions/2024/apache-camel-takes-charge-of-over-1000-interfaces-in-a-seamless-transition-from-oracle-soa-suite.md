Apache Camel leads a seamless transition, taking control of 1000+ interfaces from Oracle SOA Suite.
 
Over the last two years, we have driven forward the integration of all retail systems from a centralised and proprietary system into a microservice-oriented architecture based on Apache Camel and Openshift.
 
 
 
 The previously centralised gateways are now independent interfaces.
 
 The challenge here was to lift the countless proprietary implementations to a system that is open to all.
 
 
 
 As a result, we now have the opportunity to democratise the entire development and extend it to self-service integrations.
