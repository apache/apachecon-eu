It's back *and* it's new!

We're excited to announce that the first edition of Community over Code Europe (formerly known as ApacheCon EU) will be held at the Radisson Blu Carlton Hotel in Bratislava, Slovakia from June 03-05, 2024! This eagerly anticipated event will be our first live EU conference since 2019.

The Call for Presentations (CFP) for Community Over Code EU 2024 is now open at <a href="https://sessionize.com/coceu-2024/" target="_blank">https://sessionize.com/coceu-2024</a>.

We welcome submissions on any topic related to the Apache Software Foundation, Apache projects, or the communities around those projects. We are specifically looking for presentations in the following categories:

* API & Microservices
* Big Data Compute
* Big Data Storage
* Cassandra
* CloudStack
* Community
* Data Engineering
* Fintech
* Groovy
* Incubator
* IoT
* Performance Engineering
* Search
* Tomcat, Httpd and other servers

Additionally, we are thrilled to introduce a new feature this year: a
poster session. This addition will provide an excellent platform for
showcasing high-level projects and incubator initiatives in a visually
engaging manner. We believe this will foster lively discussions and
facilitate networking opportunities among participants.

All my best, and thanks so much for your participation,

Ryan Skraba (on behalf of the program committee)
