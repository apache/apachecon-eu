The Apache Software Foundation (ASF), composed by volunteer developers, stewards and incubators of more than 320 active Open Source projects and initiatives is celebrating its 25th anniversary in 2024! 

The ASF stewards 299M+ lines of code in 2,500+ Apache repositories across 320+ active projects. Each Apache Project is overseen by a Project Management Committee (PMC) that guides its day-to-day operations, including community development and product releases. Across the ASF, there are 209 committees managing 294 projects, including 5 special committees and 24 incubating podlings.

The Apache Software Foundation exists to provide software for the public good with support from more than 75 sponsors. ASF’s open source software is used ubiquitously around the world with more than 8,400 committers contributing to 320+ active projects including Apache Superset, Apache Camel, Apache Flink, Apache HTTP Server, Apache Kafka, and Apache Airflow. 

ASF’s annual Community Over Code event is where open source technologists convene to share best practices and use cases, forge critical relationships, and learn about advancements in their field. 

Join us for Community Over Code 2024 editions in Europe and North America to celebrate the 25th anniversary of the foundation and help shape its evolution for the next 25 years.
