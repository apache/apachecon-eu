<h2 class="text-center"><strong>Merge with a diverse and inclusive ASF EUniverse</strong></h2>


As simple as it sounds, we want us all to merge with the ASF Universe. Regardless of geography, gender, sexual orientation, dis/ability, race, ethnicity, age, religion, economic status or any other characteristic. We believe that every difference, even the smallest ones, not only make everyone unique, but also enrich the community. Diversity gives us the opportunity to keep learning and growing as human beings.

<br>

For our efforts towards Diversity & Inclusion, we have recently been awarded a Gold Badge from [CHAOSS](https://chaoss.community/diversity-and-inclusion-badging/).
