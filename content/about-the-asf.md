ASFâ€™s open source software is used ubiquitously around the world with more than 8,400 committers contributing to 320+ active projects including Apache Superset, Apache Camel, Apache Flink, Apache HTTP Server, Apache Kafka, and Apache Airflow. 
The ASF stewards 299M+ lines of code in 2,500+ Apache repositories across 320+ active projects. Each Apache Project is overseen by a Project Management Committee (PMC) that guides its day-to-day operations, including community development and product releases. Across the ASF, there are 209 committees managing 294 projects, including 5 special committees and 24 incubating podlings.
