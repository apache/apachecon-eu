I am a Senior Software Quality Engineer at Red Hat. I've been working here for 7+ years already. In my current role as a contributor to the Camel Tooling team and lead of Tooling QE group, my focus revolves around ensuring top-notch quality and advancing VS Code extensions for Apache Camel developed by Red Hat. These extensions play a role in enhancing the experience for Apache Camel developers. I am also writing blog posts about mentioned tooling on the Apache Camel Blog and posting videos on YouTube with Apache Camel experience in VS Code content.
