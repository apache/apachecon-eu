I worked as a backend developer in different companies such as Architecht, Havelsan and TOM. I research and develop big data solutions using open source technologies. I aim to be someone who has a desire to explore and has learned to learn the endless learning process. I am an energetic person who always moves forward with the logic of 1>0, who is a fighter and who cannot give up here, who always maintains his excitement.
