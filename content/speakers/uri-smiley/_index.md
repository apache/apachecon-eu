I am part of the team dedicated to developing Microsoft's Cassandra as a Service (CaaS) offering. In my current role, I have been deeply involved in performance tuning and benchmarking, both for our specific product and for Cassandra at large. My contributions include devising and implementing comprehensive workloads that are used daily to detect and address any performance regressions.
