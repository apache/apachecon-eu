I'm Software Engineer passionate about AI and Data Engineering, but before and for ever a SWE. I love Clean Code and Design Pattern, but sometimes Spaghetti Code it's fine. When I don't have a device on my hand I usually loves to make sports like water sports or climbing or crossfit, trekkings with my dog.
