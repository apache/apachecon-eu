Originally beginning my career in film, I pivoted to working in tech, first for a contextualized data start up, and now as a product manager in marketing for Instaclustr, a leader in open source technology. By drawing on my years of experiences working and studying in film, I’ve been able use those lessons to create dynamic and exciting content of all mediums and grow awareness for all things open source – all despite never taking a computer science course. 
 
 
 
 Born and raised in the US, I’ve lived, worked studied all over the globe, including the United Kingdom, Chile, East Africa, Japan, and now Australia, where I’m currently based. I hold a Master of Film Studies (Honours) from King’s College, London (United Kingdom), a Master of International Business (First Class Honours) from the University of Melbourne (Australia), and a Bachelor of Arts (Dean’s List of Honors) from the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor (United States).
