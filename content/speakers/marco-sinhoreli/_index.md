I am a Technical Marketing Manager at ShapeBlue, the leading global provider of cloud infrastructure solutions, and an Apache CloudStack expert. With over 25 years of IT experience, I have a deep understanding of cloud computing and network administration, as well as a passion for creating and delivering engaging technical marketing content.
 
 
 
 My mission is to effectively communicate with customers and prospects, both technical and non-technical, and help them make informed decisions and achieve their business goals. By providing clear, compelling, and easily digestible content, such as hands-on labs, articles, and videos, I showcase the value and potential of our products and services. I also collaborate with cross-functional teams to ensure that our marketing materials resonate with our target audience and align with our brand vision and values.
