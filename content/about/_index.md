Community Over Code is where you will learn about the latest innovations from Apache Software Foundation (ASF) projects and their communities in a collaborative, vendor-neutral environment. This year, Community Over Code will take place at the charming city of Bratislava in Slovakia where open source communities from all over the world will have an opportunity for free-form discussion and planning around our various projects.

Follow up on the conversation about Community Over Code and explore with us the ASF Universe!
