      <title>All your code belongs to Policy Makers, Politicians and the Law</title>

      <description>Software has matured and is now an integral, key, part of society, its infrastructure and economy. Yet, by and large, the industries stance on security, reliability and preventing data leaks has fallen way behind. We&amp;rsquo;re regularly front-page news. So - like all important engineering industries before it - that means that politicians all over the world have started to care. And are introducing software regulation.
Europe leads that pack with the, now final, Cyber Resilience Act and the Product Liability Directive.</description>

      <description>In the realm of sustainability, grassroots initiatives often emerge as powerful catalysts for change, driven by the collective wisdom of practitioners.
Our organization, a coalition of hundreds of software practitioners, embodies this ethos, operating on the principles of consensus and practical action. The result? Tangible solutions that directly foster meaningful change.
Enter Impact Framework, an open-source tool designed to quantify the environmental impact of software. It takes observations you can easily gather from running systems such as CPU utilisation, page views, installs, prompts and induces them into environmental impacts like carbon, waste, water.</description>

      <description>The rapid growth of the global open source community has led to the expansion of numerous projects, including the establishment of chapters in diverse regions such as Africa. This talk will explore the unique experiences and insights gained from leading an African chapter of the CHAOSS project, highlighting both the challenges faced and the victories achieved along the way. It will discuss the growth of the open source movement in Africa and emphasize the importance of building a diverse and inclusive community.</description>

      <description>The path to successful progression through the ranks of an open-source community remains unclear. Historically, the quality and quantity of oneâ€™s technical skills have been essential components in progressing through the ranks in OSS communities. Because participants conduct much of this work in coding repositories, the demonstration of technical skills drives outcomes. However, given that individuals do not typically meet face to face, as they would in a conventional organisational setting, various on-line impression management techniques such as self-promotion (i.</description>
