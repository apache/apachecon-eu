      <description>As HTTP/3 looks ready we will look to where we are with it in our servers.
The &amp;ldquo;old&amp;rdquo; HTTP/2 protocol and the corresponding TLS/SSL are common to Traffic Server, HTTP Server and Tomcat.
The presentation will shortly explain the new protocol and look to different implementation of the protocol.
Then the state of HTTP/3 in our 3 servers and how to implement HTTP/3 in them will be presented.
A small demo supporting HTTP/3 will be run.</description>

      <title>OpenSSL and QUIC using FFM</title>

      <description>This session explores the use of the FFM API from Java 22 to leverage native library capabilities, in the context of Apache Tomcat. OpenSSL is here being used to provide support for TLS through the JSSE API, without the need to use the tomcat-native wrapper library. Exploratory design of QUIC and HTTP/3 support from OpenSSL 3.3+ is also discussed.</description>
