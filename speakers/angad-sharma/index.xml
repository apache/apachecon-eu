      <description>Zomato is the Indian market leader for restaurant aggregation and food delivery.
This is a story of how Zomato leverages the power of Apache Solr at scale, some of the problems we faced and how we tackled them to reach where we are now.
Starting with just one Solr instance serving 1000 queries a day with 10K restaurants, to building and shipping a massive, first in class, search server with the capability of seamlessly searching 100 Million restaurant catalogues (SKUs), 800K+ restaurants and 50K+ unique dishes in 13 different languages at 64 Million search queries a day.</description>
