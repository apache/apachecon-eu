      <description>Open-source technology is fundamentally collaborative and transparent in nature, especially thanks to Apache projects and communities. It fosters innovation, flexibility, and community-driven development for more robust and accessible solutions. Learn how the Dremio Unified Analytics Platform can be a core part of your open source data strategy. We’ll review the role of open-source technologies in shaping modern data strategies and the benefits they offer. We’ll also learn how Dremio harnesses open-source tools, including its Apache Iceberg native data catalog that uses Project Nessie, and its foundational use Apache Arrow for in-memory analytics and Apache Arrow Flight for high-performance data transfer.</description>
