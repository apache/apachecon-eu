      <description>Monitoring and management go hand in hand in distributed storage systems, and this is true for Apache Cassandra as well. Apache Cassandra has a wide range of monitoring and management API extensions that provide insight into its internal processes and make management operations accessible.
This talk will provide an overview of several new initiatives that are closely related from a software developer&amp;rsquo;s perspective. These initiatives follow the same design principles and their overall direction can be characterized as a strategic shift in both management and monitoring from JMX to CQL.</description>
