      <description>It takes a village to run an open source project successfully. A village is usually run by its citizens and governed by some elected officials. In open source we call the citizens &amp;ldquo;users&amp;rdquo; and the people in charge of a project &amp;ldquo;maintainers&amp;rdquo;. To understand the health and sustainability of a project we should take a closer look at the community and not necessarily the code in the first place.
To understand their demographics a village can run a census.</description>
