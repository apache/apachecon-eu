      <description>Apache Druid is a real-time analytics database built for speed and scale, capable of executing complex queries against billions of rows and getting sub-second answers. Druid thrives on highly concurrent workloads, making it ideal for applications like website clickstream analysis, network performance monitoring, or handling vast IoT metrics. By using pre-aggregated data, lightning-fast columnar storage, and parallel processing we can gain insights in real-time.
In this talk, we will share techniques for improving query concurrency and achieving sub-second responses.</description>
