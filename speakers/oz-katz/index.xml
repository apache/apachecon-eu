      <description>Apache Arrow has become a de-facto standard for representing large datasets and a very useful tool in any modern data engineering stack. While it allows different technologies to better communicate and share data, the ecosystem around it enables much more!
In this talk weâ€™ll cover how Arrow interacts with Apache Spark - from allowing PySpark to interoperate with other Python data libraries, to building data-driven applications with the recent addition of Spark Connect.</description>
